# Goal: Create a step by step plan to integrate a TypeScript/SolidStart front-end with a Rust/Axum back-end
# Context:
 - The fornt-end project is here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo
 - The back-end project is here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app
 - Both projects have preliminary jsonRPC implementation
 - Both projects will be deployed in a single Docker container
 - The projects will communicate with each other over http://localhost:8080/
 - Front-end project will listen on http://localhost:3000/
 - Back-end TypeScript bindings are here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/crates/services/web-server/bindings
 - The back-end project has an example program here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/crates/services/web-server/examples/quick_dev.rs
# Tasks
 - Review the above projects and files
 - Consider how the projects will be configured for jsonRPC communication
 - The goal of the plan should be to recreate the Rust example program as a SolidStart example page that comunicates with the back-end over jsonRPC
 - The SolidStart example page should be located here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo/src/routes/fullstack.tsx
 - The SolidStart example page should be component based 
 - The SolidStart example page should have a user interface similar to the existing SolidStart page here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo/src/routes/index.tsx
 - The SolidStart example page should have a test file similar in scope to /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo/e2e/home.spec.ts
 - Any components created for the SolidStart example page should have corresponding tests siilar to this: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo/src/components/Counter.test.tsx
 - Consider alternatives to architectural or other technical choices an assumptons
 - Recomend ways the front-end to back-end communication can be simplified or made more reliable
 - Create a step by step plan that Claude can execute 
 - Write the step by step plan here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/planning/full_stack_integration.md

 ⏺ Claude created a comprehensive step-by-step plan at /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/planning/full_stack_integration.md.

  Summary

  The plan covers:

  Architecture Analysis:
  - Identified key integration challenges (cookie auth, CORS, BigInt serialization)
  - Recommended using custom fetch-based RPC client with CORS on backend

  Implementation Phases:

  1. Phase 1: Types & RPC Client - Copy TypeScript bindings, create extended types, build custom RPC client
  2. Phase 2: CORS Configuration - Add tower-http CORS middleware to Rust backend
  3. Phase 3: Components - Create 5 components (AuthContext, LoginForm, AgentManager, ConversationManager, MessagePanel)
  4. Phase 4: Fullstack Page - Wire up components at /fullstack route
  5. Phase 5: Testing - Component tests with vitest, E2E tests with Playwright

  Files to Create:
  - 8 component/library files
  - 3 test files
  - TypeScript type definitions

  Alternatives Evaluated:
  - Server function proxy (no CORS but added complexity)
  - WebSocket for real-time (better UX but more backend work)
  - OpenAPI code generation (automatic sync but more tooling)
  - tRPC-style sharing (single source of truth but requires monorepo)

  The plan maps each step from quick_dev.rs to corresponding SolidStart components and provides ready-to-implement code for all files.
