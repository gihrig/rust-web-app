# Goal: Create a step by step plan to integrate a TypeScript/SolidStart front-end with a Rust/Axum back-end
# Context:
 - The front-end project is here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo
 - The back-end project is here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app
 - Both projects have preliminary jsonRPC implementation
 - Both projects will be deployed in a single Docker container
 - The projects will communicate with each other over http://localhost:8080/
 - Front-end project will listen on http://localhost:3000/
 - Back-end TypeScript bindings are here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/crates/services/web-server/bindings
 - The back-end project has an example program here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/crates/services/web-server/examples/quick_dev.rs
# Tasks
 - Review the above projects and files
 - Consider how the projects will be configured for jsonRPC communication
 - The goal of the plan should be to recreate the Rust example program as a SolidStart example page that communicates with the back-end over jsonRPC
 - The SolidStart example page should be located here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo/src/routes/fullstack.tsx
 - The SolidStart example page should be component based
 - The SolidStart example page should have a user interface similar to the existing SolidStart page here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo/src/routes/index.tsx
 - The SolidStart example page should have a test file similar in scope to /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo/e2e/home.spec.ts
 - Any components created for the SolidStart example page should have corresponding tests similar to this: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo/src/components/Counter.test.tsx
 - Consider alternatives to architectural or other technical choices an assumptons
 - Recommend ways the front-end to back-end communication can be simplified or made more reliable
 - Create a step by step plan that Claude can execute
 - Write the step by step plan here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/planning/full_stack_integration.md

 ⏺ Claude created a comprehensive step-by-step plan at /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/planning/full_stack_integration.md.

  Summary

  The plan covers:

  Architecture Analysis:
  - Identified key integration challenges (cookie auth, CORS, BigInt serialization)
  - Recommended using custom fetch-based RPC client with CORS on backend

  Implementation Phases:

  1. Phase 1: Types & RPC Client - Copy TypeScript bindings, create extended types, build custom RPC client
  2. Phase 2: CORS Configuration - Add tower-http CORS middleware to Rust backend
  3. Phase 3: Components - Create 5 components (AuthContext, LoginForm, AgentManager, ConversationManager, MessagePanel)
  4. Phase 4: Fullstack Page - Wire up components at /fullstack route
  5. Phase 5: Testing - Component tests with vitest, E2E tests with Playwright

  Files to Create:
  - 8 component/library files
  - 3 test files
  - TypeScript type definitions

  Alternatives Evaluated:
  - Server function proxy (no CORS but added complexity)
  - WebSocket for real-time (better UX but more backend work)
  - OpenAPI code generation (automatic sync but more tooling)
  - tRPC-style sharing (single source of truth but requires monorepo)

  The plan maps each step from quick_dev.rs to corresponding SolidStart components and provides ready-to-implement code for all files.

# Goal: Update the plan document to reflect the choice of alternatives listed here

# Context:

- The plan document is here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/planning/full_stack_integration.md
- The front-end project is here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo
- The back-end project is here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app
- Both projects will be deployed together in a single Docker container

## Plan Document Section:
### Recommendations for Simplification & Reliability @line 45

Lists alternative approaches
#### Option A: Direct Fetch with Custom RPC Client (Recommended) @line 47
#### Option C: Configure CORS on Rust Back-end (Current Assumption) @line 57

### Recommendation @line 79

** Option A (Direct Fetch) combined with Option C (CORS)** @line 81

## Plan Document Section:
### Part 5: Alternative Approaches @line 1189

#### Alternative 1: WebSocket for Real-time Updates

Instead of polling or manual refresh, use WebSocket for real-time message updates.

# Tasks:
1. Review the Plan Document here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/planning/full_stack_integration.md
2. Refer to the back-end Rust project as needed here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app
3. Refer to the front-end SolidStart project as needed here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Javascript/SolidJS/SolidStart-Demo
4. Update the Plan Document to reflect "Option A (Direct Fetch) combined with Option C (CORS)" @line 81 in the existing Plan Document
5. Update the Plan Document to reflect "Alternative 1: WebSocket for Real-time Updates" @line 1191 in the existing Plan Document
6. Add "Completed" checkboxes to each phase/step in the Plan Document allowing Claude execute the plan in sequence and keep track of what has already been done
7. Write change back to the Plan Document here: /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/planning/full_stack_integration2.md

  Summary of Changes

  1. Selected Approach Clearly Marked:
  - Added a "Selected Approach Summary" section at the top highlighting: Option A (Direct Fetch) + Option C (CORS) +
  Alternative 1 (WebSocket)
  - Marked each option with [SELECTED] or [NOT SELECTED] tags
  - Added explanations for why alternatives were not selected

  2. WebSocket Integration Added (Alternative 1):
  - Added new Phase 3: WebSocket Support for Real-time Updates with:
    - Step 3.1: Add WebSocket Handler to Rust Back-end

    - Step 3.3: Broadcast Events on Data Changes
  - Added new Step 4.1: Create WebSocket Client Hook (src/lib/websocket.ts)
  - Updated MessagePanel component to use WebSocket for real-time message updates
  - Added WebSocket types to the TypeScript types file
  - Added WebSocket tests

# Goal:
- Begin ### Phase 1: Setup TypeScript Types & RPC Client @line 93 in /Users/glen/Documents/Development/Study/Rust/Rust_10X/rust-web-app/planning/full_stack_integration.md
# Context:
- Complete #### Step 1.1: Copy TypeScript Bindings to Front-end @line 95
- Mark Step 1.1 as Complete
- Do not move beyond this step

---

⏺ Step 1.1 Complete.

  I copied the following TypeScript bindings from the Rust back-end to the SolidStart front-end:

  Source: rust-web-app/crates/services/web-server/bindings/
  Destination: SolidStart-Demo/src/types/backend/

  Files copied (10 total):
  - Agent.d.ts - Agent entity type
  - Conv.d.ts - Conversation entity type
  - ConvKind.d.ts - Conversation kind enum ("OwnerOnly" | "MultiUsers")
  - ConvState.d.ts - Conversation state enum ("Active" | "Archived")
  - ConvMsg.d.ts - Conversation message type
  - ConvUser.d.ts - Conversation user relationship type
  - User.d.ts - User entity type
  - UserTyp.d.ts - User type enum ("Sys" | "User")
  - ParamsIded.d.ts - RPC params with ID
  - ParamsForUpdate.d.ts - RPC params for update operations

  Note: I included User.d.ts, UserTyp.d.ts, and ConvUser.d.ts which were not in the original plan but exist in the
  bindings and may be useful for the integration.

⏺ Now do Step 1.2 create extended types

---

Yes

---

⏺ Step 1.2 Complete.

  Created SolidStart-Demo/src/types/backend/index.ts with:

  Re-exports (10 types):
  - Agent, Conv, ConvKind, ConvState, ConvMsg, ConvUser, User, UserTyp, ParamsIded, ParamsForUpdate

  Input types for create/update operations:
  - AgentForCreate - name field
  - AgentForUpdate - optional name
  - ConvForCreate - agent_id, optional title/kind
  - ConvForUpdate - optional owner_id, title, state
  - ConvMsgForCreate - conv_id, content

  Auth payloads:
  - LoginPayload - username, pwd
  - LogoffPayload - logoff boolean

  JSON-RPC types:
  - JsonRpcRequest<P> - standard JSON-RPC 2.0 request
  - JsonRpcSuccessResponse<T> - success response with result.data
  - JsonRpcErrorResponse - error response with message and optional details
  - JsonRpcResponse<T> - union type
  - isRpcError() - type guard function

  WebSocket types:
  - WsMessage - message envelope with type and payload
  - WsConvMsgPayload - conversation message payload
  - WsSubscription - subscribe/unsubscribe request
